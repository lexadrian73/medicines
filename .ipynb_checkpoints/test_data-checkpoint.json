In some cell lines, such as SF-295 glioma cells, schweinfurthins elicit cytotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations. However, other cell lines, like A549 lung cancer cells, are resistant to schweinfurthin treatment up to micromolar concentrations. At this time, the precise mechanism of action and target for these compounds is unknown. Here, we employ RNA sequencing of cells treated with 50\u00a0nM schweinfurthin analog TTI-3066 for 6 and 24\u00a0h to elucidate potential mechanisms and pathways which may contribute to schweinfurthin sensitivity and resistance. The data was analyzed via an interaction model to observe differential behaviors between sensitive SF-295 and resistant A549 cell lines. We show that metabolic and stress-response pathways were differentially regulated in the sensitive SF-295 cell line as compared with the resistant A549 cell line. In contrast, A549 cell had significant alterations in response genes involved in translation and protein metabolism. Overall, there was a significant interaction effect for translational proteins, RNA metabolism, protein metabolism, and metabolic genes. Members of the Hedgehog pathway were differentially regulated in the resistant A549 cell line at both early and late time points, suggesting a potential mechanism of resistance. Indeed, when cotreated with the Smoothened inhibitor cyclopamine, A549 cells became more sensitive to schweinfurthin treatment. This study therefore identifies a key interplay with the Hedgehog pathway that modulates sensitivity to the schweinfurthin class of compounds."},{"index":1,"id":2,"pudmedid":34237644,"title":"Novel thienopyrimidine-aminothiazole hybrids: Design, synthesis, antimicrobial screening, anticancer activity, effects on cell cycle profile, caspase-3 mediated apoptosis and VEGFR-2 inhibition.","abstract":"A series of novel hybrid compounds of hexahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine with aminothiazole scaffolds were synthesized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against the NCI-60 human tumor cell line panel. Compounds 7c, 7d and 7e exhibited significant antiproliferative activities at 10<sup>-5<\/sup> M dose. Compound 7c exhibited excellent cytotoxic activity against CNS cancer cell lines including SNB-75 and SF-295 as well as renal cancer cell line CAKI-1 when compared with sorafenib as standard anticancer drug. In addition, compound 7d showed almost comparable anticancer activity to sorafenib against SNB-75 cell line and displayed moderate activity against SF-295 and CAKI-1 cell lines in comparison to sorafenib. Compound 7c inhibited the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 62.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0nM and decreased both total VEGFR-2 and phosphorylated VEGFR-2 in treated SNB-75 cells suggesting its ability to down regulate cell proliferation, growth, and survival.. The flow cytometric analysis showed that 7c displayed its cytotoxic activity through the reduction of the cellular proliferation and induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2\/M phase. Compound 7c clearly boosted the level of the apoptotic caspase-3. All the synthesized compounds were also screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against four pathogenic strains of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative as well as Candida albicans.

As MT3 plays a role in autophagy in astrocytes, here, we investigated its role in irradiated glioma cells. Irradiation increased autophagy flux in GL261 glioma cells as evidenced by increased levels of LC3-II but decreased levels of p62 (SQSTM1). Indicating that autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in glioma cell survival following irradiation, measures inhibiting autophagy flux at various steps decreased their clonogenic survival of irradiated GL261 as well as SF295 and U251 glioma cells. Knockdown of MT3 with siRNA in irradiated glioma cells induced arrested autophagy, and decreased cell survival. At the same time, the accumulation of labile zinc in lysosomes was markedly attenuated by MT3 knockdown. Indicating that such zinc accumulation was important in autophagy flux, chelation of zinc with tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), induced arrested autophagy in and reduced survival of GL261 cells following irradiation. Suggesting a possible mechanism for arrested autophagy, MT3 knockdown and zinc chelation were found to impair lysosomal acidification. Since autophagy flux plays a cytoprotective role in irradiated glioma cells, present results suggest that MT3 and zinc may be regarded as possible therapeutic targets to sensitize glioma cells to ionizing radiation therapy."},{"index":5,"id":6,"pudmedid":30836914,"title":"Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity of Mefloquine-Based Analogs Against Sensitive and Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains.","abstract":"Background and Introduction: Mefloquine, a drug used to prevent and treat malaria is described possessing activity against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as well as against multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR) and other types of bacteria.

Being very resistant to the current therapies, since even under treatment, surgery, and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), patients achieve a median survival of one year. In the search for more effective therapies, new molecules have been designed. For nervous system cancers, molecules able to cross the blood-brain barrier are handled with priority. Accordingly, tacrine was chosen for this study and the inclusion of spiro-heterocyclic rings was done in its structure resulting in new compounds. Cytotoxic activity of tacrine derivatives was assayed using glioblastoma cell line (SF295) as well as analyzing cell death mechanism. Increased caspases activities were observed, confirming apoptosis as cell death type. Some derivatives also increased reactive oxygen species formation and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, compounds acted on several glioblastoma-related proteins including p53, HLA-DR, beta-catenin, Iba-1, MAP2c, Olig-2, and IDH1.

Studies focusing on molecules that regulate tumorigenesis or tumor immunity may provide potential therapeutic strategies for patients with glioma. B7-H6 is selectively expressed in tumor cells and plays vital roles in host immune responses. In this study, we demonstrated that B7-H6 was expressed in glioma cell lines, including CRT, U251, SHG-44, SF-295, TG-905 and U373, and tumor tissues isolated from glioma patients. Moreover, the expression levels of B7-H6 were significantly correlated with glioma grade. Previous studies reported that inflammatory mediators and cytokines induced the expression of B7 family members including programmed death-ligand 1, B7-H2 and B7-H4. Therefore, we explored the regulation of B7-H6 expression in gliomas and showed that lipopolysaccharide induced the expression of B7-H6 in glioma cells. To further analyze the roles of B7-H6 in gliomas, the expression of B7-H6 in glioma cells was knocked down. The results of cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell migration and invasion assays demonstrated that the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells were inhibited after knocking down B7-H6. To elucidate the specific mechanisms of B7-H6 function in cancer progression, we examined the expression levels of proteins involved in cell apoptosis, migration and invasion. We demonstrated that the expression levels of E-cadherin and Bcl-2 associated X protein increased, and the expression levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and survivin decreased after knocking down B7-H6. In conclusion, B7-H6 plays important roles in glioma, and targeting B7-H6 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for glioma patients."},{"index":8,"id":9,"pudmedid":29660689,"title":"Quinonoid compounds via reactions of lawsone and 2-aminonaphthoquinone with \u03b1-bromonitroalkenes and nitroallylic acetates: Structural diversity by C-ring modification and cytotoxic evaluation against cancer cells.","abstract":"Morita-Baylis-Hillman acetates and \u03b1-bromonitroalkenes have been employed in cascade reactions with lawsone and 2-aminonaphthoquinone for the one-pot synthesis of heterocycle fused quinonoid compounds.
